  Augmented reality is a computer program that overlays graphics over real world objects  
Users are not able to see anything projected outside of the screen  
USES  
A Head Mounted Display (HMD) is a device that can be worn on a helmet or attached to the head – it often resembles glasses  
Google Glass was a popular AR topic in 2012 – the HMD was meant to be a replacement for or to be used in conjunction to a smartphone. The device displayed information about a location that the user looks at with the glasses. Algorithms in the HMD’s computer used an integrated GPS system and photographic input to get information on the place and give information about it  
AR in Recreation  
A popular app for iOS and Android released recently was Pokémon Go, an app that uses GPS data and camera input to generate random objects that users interact with  
Sony and Microsoft have incorporated AR in their last two generations of consoles, PlayStation 3 and 4 and Xbox 360 and One. These systems use the PlayStation Eye/Camera and the Xbox Kinect to project the user’s movements into a video game  
AR used in research  
AR has been used in conjunction to ultrasound tech to perform medical operations, with the accuracy to perform operations such as a needle biopsy  
AR has been used to project infrared scans of a patient’s veins   
AR is used for basic training for surgeons, high-rise operators, machinery operators... with no consequences and less pressure since it's not real  
AR used in education  
Students can use interactive 3D models projected in/onto a space  
A program called MagicBook is used in conjunction with AR to immerse readers with 3D models of objects in the pages  
AR has many almost given uses, such as projecting and manipulating the 3D structure of molecules  
A popular app used by teachers is Aurasma, which can be used to overlay information onto objects detected by a smart phone's camera  
AR commercial uses  
In the military, soldiers use a heads-up display (HUD) to see info onto tagged objects in the world as well as radar info and sensor data
